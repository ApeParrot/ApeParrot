## 🧭 About me
I’m an Italian postdoctoral researcher at the **Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI), TUM**. My work focuses on **magnetic sensing & modeling**, **wearable/soft robotics**, and **physical human–robot interaction**, with the broader goal of making human–robot interfaces more natural and intuitive. I’m currently funded by a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship** (project **SCOUT**).  
🧪 Past stops include **Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna** (PhD, Biorobotics) and **Heidelberg University**.

---

## 🔬 Research themes
- **Magnetic sensing for prosthetics & exoskins** — from modeling to embedded implementation.
- **Wearable robotics & pHRI** — control, intent inference, and safe assistance.
- **Mechatronics for human–machine interfaces** — robust sensing pipelines for out-of-lab use.

---

## 🎓 Education (short)
- **PhD, Biorobotics (cum laude)** — Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna (2023)  
- **MSc, Bionics Engineering (110/110 cum laude)** — University of Pisa & SSSA (2019)  
- **BSc, Information Engineering (110/110)** — University of Padua (2017)  
During my PhD I worked on the **Myokinetic Interface** for dexterous control and proprioceptive feedback in transradial amputees and contributed to national/EU projects (e.g., **ERC Starting Grant Myki**).

---

## 🏆 Selected milestones
- 🏅 **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (SCOUT)**, 2024.
- 🥇 **ICRA’24 TC Workshop Poster – 1st Prize**, “Supervised Autonomy: How to Shape Human-Robot Interaction…” (Heidelberg Univ.).
